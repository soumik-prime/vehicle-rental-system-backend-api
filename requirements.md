# 🚗 Vehicle Rental System

## 🎯 Project Overview

A backend API for a vehicle rental management system that handles:
- **Vehicles** - Manage vehicle inventory with availability tracking
- **Customers** - Manage customer accounts and profiles
- **Bookings** - Handle vehicle rentals, returns and cost calculation
- **Authentication** - Secure role-based access control (Admin and Customer roles)

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Node.js** + **TypeScript**
- **Express.js** (web framework)
- **PostgreSQL** (database)
- **bcrypt** (password hashing)
- **jsonwebtoken** (JWT authentication)

---

## 📁 Code Structure

> **IMPORTANT:** Your implementation **MUST** follow a **modular pattern** with clear separation of concerns. Organize your code into feature-based modules (e.g., auth, users, vehicles, bookings) with proper layering (routes, controllers, services).

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### User Roles
- **Admin** - Full system access to manage vehicles, users and all bookings
- **Customer** - Can register, view vehicles, create/manage own bookings

### Authentication Flow
1. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage into the database
2. User login via `/api/v1/auth/signin` and receives a JWT (JSON Web Token)
3. Protected endpoints require token in header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
4. Validates the token and checks user permissions
5. Access granted if authorized, otherwise returns 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden)
